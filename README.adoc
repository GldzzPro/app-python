= Building Neo4j Applications with Python

> Learn how to interact with Neo4j from Python using the Neo4j Python Driver

This repository accompanies the link:https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/courses/app-python/[Building Neo4j Applications with Python course^] on link:https://graphacademy.neo4j.com/[Neo4j GraphAcademy^].

== A Note on comments

You may spot a number of comments in this repository that look a little like this:

[source,python]
----
# tag::something[]
someCode()
# end::something[]
----


We use link:https://asciidoc-py.github.io/index.html[Asciidoc^] to author our courses.
Using these tags means that we can use a macro to include portions of code directly into the course itself.

From the point of view of the course, you can go ahead and ignore them.


== Setting up your environment

[source,sh]
----
python -m venv neoflix

source neoflix/bin/activate
----



== Running the Application

[source,sh]
export FLASK_APP=api
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run

== Neo4j Scaffold

This repository includes a minimal Neo4j schema and ingest prototype that demonstrates how to:

* Create and enforce schema constraints
* Create and query Module and Instance nodes
* Establish relationships between nodes

=== Installation

Install the required dependencies:

[source,sh]
----
pip install -r requirements.txt
----

=== Configuration

Copy the example environment file and update it with your Neo4j AuraDB credentials:

[source,sh]
----
cp .env.example .env
----

Edit the `.env` file to include your Neo4j connection details:

[source]
----
NEO4J_URI=neo4j+s://your-aura-instance-id.databases.neo4j.io
NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your-password
----

=== Initialize Database Schema

Run the initialization script to create the necessary constraints and indexes:

[source,sh]
----
python init_db.py
----

=== Ingest Mock Data

Populate the database with sample data:

[source,sh]
----
python ingest_mock.py
----

=== Run Tests

Verify that the schema and data ingestion worked correctly:

=== Authentication

**No Auth Required**

This service runs with admin privileges solely via Neo4j credentials. All endpoints operate with superuser access, with no JWT or OAuth2 authentication required. The application uses only the Neo4j connection parameters (NEO4J_URI, NEO4J_USERNAME, NEO4J_PASSWORD) for database access.

[source,sh]
----
pytest tests/test_schema_and_ingest.py -v
----
